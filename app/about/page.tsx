          Hi, I&apos;m Marko!üëã For years, my life was just work, work, work. As
          a software developer, I spent long hours at the computer, snacking on
          whatever was quick and easy (spoiler: it wasn&apos;t salads).
          Exercise? That word wasn&apos;t in my vocabulary unless I was
          programming it into an app.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It wasn&apos;t until I noticed how this lifestyle was{" "}

            dragging me down
          </strong>{" "}
          that I decided to make a change. I started working out a bit at a
          time, figuring out how to eat better, and surprisingly, I began to
          enjoy it. I lost 15 pounds, started seeing some muscle definition, and
          most importantly, I felt energized and ready to take on the world.
