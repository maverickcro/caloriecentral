            Welcome! I&apos;m Marko, a former soccer enthusiast turned tech
            geek. Transitioning from sports to a tech career, I noticed the toll
            a sedentary lifestyle took on my health. After gaining unwanted
            weight, I delved into the world of nutrition, discovering the power
            of caloric balance. Losing 15 pounds and gaining muscle, I&apos;ve
            learned that effective dieting isn&apos;t about
            restrictionsâ€”it&apos;s about understanding and enjoying food. Join
            me as I share insights on smart eating without the guilt.
