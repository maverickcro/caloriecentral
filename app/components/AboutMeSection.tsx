            Hiüëã, I&apos;m Marko. After starting corporate life, I never had
            time for anything. Every day was the same, I would work for 10
            hours, ate mostly junk food and fitness became a foreign word. I was
            too lazy to do anything about it because I felt I had more important
            things to do. After a couple of years, my sedentary lifestyle took a
            toll on my health. I haven&apos;t played many sports, had a terrible
            diet, and had no idea about healthy habits. I took matters into my
            own hands, started working out, and improved my diet. A good plan
            was all it took. I&apos;ve lost 15 pounds, gained some muscle and
            now I feel better than ever. I made it my addiction. As a software
            developer, I decided to make some essential calculators from the
            knowledge I learned through my journey, as well as some additional
            ones. I truly hope they will help you as well üôè.
